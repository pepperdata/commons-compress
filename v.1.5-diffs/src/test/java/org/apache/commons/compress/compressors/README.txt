  The diff is between the original Apache Commons Compress v. 1.5 source file
  and the *minimally* changed PD-specific source file (i.e., as went into release
  1.5-pd4).  However, the *source* file kept here is the PD-specific source files
  that has been structurally reorganized/reshuffled to as closely match the layout
  of the new Apache Commons Compress v. 1.26.2 source file as possible, so that it's
  easier to do a side-by-side diff with the v. 1.26.2 file.
